# Analyzing-Global-YouTube-Trending-Videos-Impact-of-Engagement-Metrics-and-Country-Specific-Trends
# Overview
YouTube, the world's largest video streaming platform, is on a mission to optimize the trending duration of videos globally in order to increase video views. The Head of Product for trending videos has recognized that the impact of various engagement metrics, such as likes, comments, and dislikes, can significantly affect the trending status of videos. However, this impact may vary from country to country due to differences in demographics and video consumption habits. In response to this challenge, the Head of Product has tasked your team with conducting an analysis to understand how the average trending duration of videos differs across countries and how engagement metrics influence this duration.

# Business Problem
The main business problem revolves around analyzing YouTube's trending videos in various countries and investigating the role of engagement metrics in determining the trending duration of these videos. Specifically, the following aspects need to be addressed:

1.) Country-Specific Analysis: YouTube's trending videos vary by location, and the demographics and preferences of different countries play a significant role in shaping trends. The analysis should assess how the average trending duration of videos differs from one country to another.

2.) Impact of Engagement Metrics: The study should explore how engagement metrics such as likes, dislikes, and comments affect the duration of trending videos. Understanding the relationship between these metrics and trending duration is crucial for optimizing video promotion strategies.

3.) Insight Generation: Beyond addressing the primary questions, the analysis should uncover interesting insights from the data through exploratory data analysis (EDA). These insights can help YouTube make informed decisions and discover trends that might not be immediately apparent.

# Dataset Description:
To conduct this analysis, three key datasets are available:

1.) YT_trending_videos: This dataset contains video-level information, including dates when videos were trending and various metrics like comments, likes, views, etc.

2.) YT_channel_map: This dataset provides mapping between channel IDs and channel titles (channel names) on YouTube.

3.) YT_category_map: This dataset includes mappings for category IDs used to classify videos based on their type, such as movies, trailers, animation, etc.

This project aims to provide YouTube with valuable insights into the factors influencing video trending durations, enabling them to optimize video promotion strategies and enhance the user experience across different countries.
